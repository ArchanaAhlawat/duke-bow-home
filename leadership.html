                            <p>Alexandra Martin is our Vice President of Communications. She joined BOW the fall of her sophomore year and served on exec as the Communications Chair the following year. She is a rising senior, majoring in Public Policy with a minor in Economics. BOW allowed Alexandra to realize and cultivate her interest in the financial markets, and she is now spending the summer interning in the Global Capital Markets division of Morgan Stanley in New York City. The summer before her junior year she worked at an institutional research boutique in DC called Washington Analysis. The firm anticipates and analyzes changes in public policy that will impact the financial markets.  As an analyst intern she conducted extensive research, attended hearings, and coauthored notes for distribution to investor clients. Alexandra’s involvement on campus has reached beyond BOW as a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, crew leader for the freshman pre-orientation program PBUILD, and publicist for the online publication The Standard. She has really enjoyed her time on exec and is excited to return in her new position.</p>

							<p>Alexandra Martin is our Vice President of Communications. She joined
							BOW the fall of her sophomore year and served on exec as the
							Communications Chair the following year. She is a rising senior,
							majoring in Public Policy with a minor in Economics. BOW allowed
							Alexandra to realize and cultivate her interest in the financial
							markets, and she is now spending the summer interning in the Global
							Capital Markets division of Morgan Stanley in New York City. The summer
							before her junior year she worked at an institutional research boutique
							in DC called Washington Analysis. The firm anticipates and analyzes
							changes in public policy that will impact the financial markets. As an
							analyst intern she conducted extensive research, attended hearings, and
							coauthored notes for distribution to investor clients. Alexandra’s
							involvement on campus has reached beyond BOW as a member of Kappa Alpha
							Theta, crew leader for the freshman pre-orientation program PBUILD, and
							publicist for the online publication The Standard. She has really
							enjoyed her time on exec and is excited to return in her new
							position.</p>
